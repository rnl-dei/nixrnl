   Synopsis: filterHosts filters hosts

   Filter and select hosts from the provided attribute set based on the specified filters.

   Inputs:
   - filters: A list of functions that receive a host's configuration as an argument and return a boolean value.
   - hosts: An attribute set representing NixOS system configurations for multiple hosts.

   Output Format:
   An attribute set containing a subset of hosts from the provided `hosts` attribute set that satisfy all the specified filters. The function applies the filters to each host's configuration and includes only those hosts that pass all the filters.

   Example:
   filterHosts [ (config: config.services.nginx.enable) ] {
     webserver1 = <nixosConfiguration>;
     webserver2 = <nixosConfiguration>;
     host3 = <nixosConfiguration>;
   }

   Example output:
   {
     "webserver1" = { ... };
     "webserver2" = { ... };
   }
