# NixOS @ RNL

This repository contains the infrastructure setup for RNL (Rede das Novas Licenciaturas) using NixOS, a purely functional Linux distribution built on the Nix package manager. The infrastructure is designed to support the various components and services required for running servers and labs at [DEI](https://dei.tecnico.ulisboa.pt).
